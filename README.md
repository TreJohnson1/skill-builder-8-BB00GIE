# Skill Builder 8
## Unit testing exercise
Using the included bare test classes, test all the methods in the GamePiece and TicTacToe classes.  Find and correct all errors.  Make sure to have a test for each method and to use equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, negative and positive testing.

Once you have completed your work, mark the assignment as completed by placing an X between the brackets below.

commit and push your work to your repository.

## Steps to Clone Your Repository
The following steps assumes you have already used the invite link to the Skill Builder 8 repository.  If you have not done so, please contact your instructor for the invite link.

Complete the following steps:
1. Log in to github.com and go to your *Skill Builder 8* repository.
2. Find the green button that says "Close or Download" and copy the URL for the repository.  Make sure to select the *Use HTTPS* option and **NOT** the Use SSH option.  So, the URL should start with *HTTPS:* and **NOT** *git:*
3. In the terminal, change the directory to where you store your course work.
    e.g. `cd Documents/CSCI-121`
4. Create a new directory called **SkillBuilder8** by typing the command `mkdir SkillBuilder8` in the terminal
5. Type in the following command:  `git clone <Repository URL> SkillBuilder8` where *<Repository>* is the URL you copied in step 2
    e.g. `git clone https://mrasamny/skill-builder-8 SkillBuilder8`
6.  Now you can work on SkillBuilder8.
  
## How to Commit Your Work
You should get in the habit of versioning your work as you code.  In this assignment, once you complete coding the GamePieceTest class, you should stage and commit your work.  For this example, this would take the following steps:
1. `git add GamePieceTest.java`
   Note: if you modified more than one file (i.e. GamePiece.java as well),   then use `git add .`
2. Commit your work by typing: `git commit -m "commit message"`
